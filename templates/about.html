        <p class=" offset-md-1 col-md-10 text-center">
            Working in multinational corporations made us realize that some of our colleagues did not love their jobs/bosses/clients
            and they were generally not content. They were complaining and pessimistic many times, could not wait for Fridays
            and dreaded Monday mornings. In some close conversations, many of them shared with us that if they had a second
            chanceâ€¦.. they would do something different in life. They would choose a life and career of passion because they
            realized that money and a stable job alone do not bring happiness. What brings that satisfaction and fulfilment
            is doing things we love, creating positive impact and sharing our gifts and talents with others. So we quit our
            jobs and here we are: We started Human Circle with a single minded determination to change the mindset of people
            to do what they love, create an impactful career and make the world a better place with their passion.
